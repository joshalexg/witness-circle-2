    <h3>Q&A</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Q: Does it matter which denomination of faith I practice?</li>
      <li>A: We can create a ceremony as religious, spiritual, or secular as you wish. In the past I’ve incorporated elements from Korean, Jewish, Catholic, and Palestinian traditions, among others. From the setup of the chairs to the structure of readings and vows, I will work with you to create a ceremony whose every element reflects you and your partner. The heart of the process is an inclusive, pan-cultural tradition that honors and welcomes all the ways of blessing marriage and each other.</li>


      <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>

      <li>A: Yes! In the event you’ve already been to a City Hall, or live in a state where our work is not a legal ceremony, the process becomes that much more resonant, reaching through convention and expectations to bring your family and friends close to share your commitment to a life together!</li>


      <li>Q: Are you able to accommodate destination weddings?</li>
      <li>A: Yes, I currently work with a destination wedding company, and also work privately. Prices are distinct for destination weddings, and I network with a team of wonderful professionals to provide every element for your getaway wedding!</li>

      <li>Q: What other kinds of ceremonies do you create?</li>

      <li>A: Weddings are a beautiful chance to mark one of life’s great thresholds, but too many of life’s moments slip by without appreciating and marking them in ceremony. Bought a new house? Let’s create a wonderful house blessing to start fresh in your new home. Is there a new little one in the family? Let’s welcome them with a personal, joyful baby blessing! From the passing of elders to a shift in jobs, our lives are filled with significant opportunities to give thanks for what has been, welcome what is present, and move ahead with hope, support, and joy!</li>

      <li>Q: Are you a registered officiant?</li>
      <li>A: I am a legally-registered officiant, authorized and recognized by the State of New York.</li>


      <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>
      <li>A: Yes! In the event you’ve already been to a City Hall, or live in a state where our work is not a legal ceremony, the process becomes that much more resonant, reaching through convention and expectations to bring your family and friends close to share your commitment to a life together!</li>

      <li>Q: I’m looking for someone that will get to know me and my partner. What’s the process?</li>
      <li>A: Sitting together, you’ll access a deep connection with your wedding, and your marriage. I’ve worked with couples from three weeks to nine months before their ceremony. We have a dialogue about what your wedding is marking, what’s already true in your relationship, and the most resonant way to embody that in a wedding ceremony that’s personal, memorable, and fun!</li>
