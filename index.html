              Clearly stating your intent and inviting us all to support you in it creates

                  <p id="about-section">
                      I have been active with faith-based ceremony work for over ten years.
                      In 2003 I completed MLA’s Leadership Training Program in Sapphire Canyon,
                      Colorado, and have served several times as a Guide with The Berkshire Men’s Circle.
                      I have gone on to study Rites Of Passage work such as participating in Vision Fast
                      ceremonies with the School of Lost Borders in Big Pine, California,
                      and serving on staff with the Men’s Leadership Alliance in Eldora, Colorado.
                      I am also a registered officiant with the State of New York, and a
                      trained Life and Career Coach. I will work with you to craft a ceremony
                      that speaks to your faith, focusing the words of your ceremony towards
                      the intention of your commitment. Deeply rooted in community, passion,
                       and spirit, I offer an inclusive and joyful presence for your wedding celebration!</p>

            <div id="qa" class="body-div">
              <h3>Q&A</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Q: Does it matter which denomination of faith I practice?</li>
                <li>A: We can create a ceremony as religious, spiritual, or secular as you wish.
                  In the past I’ve incorporated elements from Korean, Jewish, Catholic, and
                  Palestinian traditions, among others. From the setup of the chairs to the
                  structure of readings and vows, I will work with you to create a ceremony
                  whose every element reflects you and your partner. The heart of the process
                  is an inclusive, pan-cultural tradition that honors and welcomes all the ways
                  of blessing marriage and each other.</li>


                <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment
                  with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>
                <li>A: Yes! In the event you’ve already been to a City Hall, or live in a
                  state where our work is not a legal ceremony, the process becomes that
                  much more resonant, reaching through convention and expectations to bring
                  your family and friends close to share your commitment to a life together!</li>


                <li>Q: Are you able to accommodate destination weddings?</li>
                <li>A: Yes, I currently work with a destination wedding company, and also work
                  privately. Prices are distinct for destination weddings, and I network with
                  a team of wonderful professionals to provide every element for your getaway wedding!</li>

                <li>Q: What other kinds of ceremonies do you create?</li>
                <li>A: Weddings are a beautiful chance to mark one of life’s great thresholds,
                  but too many of life’s moments slip by without appreciating and marking
                  them in ceremony. Bought a new house? Let’s create a wonderful house
                  blessing to start fresh in your new home. Is there a new little one
                  in the family? Let’s welcome them with a personal, joyful baby blessing!
                  From the passing of elders to a shift in jobs, our lives are filled with
                  significant opportunities to give thanks for what has been, welcome what is
                  present, and move ahead with hope, support, and joy!</li>

                <li>Q: Are you a registered officiant?</li>
                <li>A: I am a legally-registered officiant, authorized and recognized by the State of New York.</li>


                <li>Q: We already had a civil ceremony, and now want to share our commitment
                  with our friends and family. Can you work with us?</li>
                <li>A: Yes! In the event you’ve already been to a City Hall, or live in a
                  state where our work is not a legal ceremony, the process becomes that
                  much more resonant, reaching through convention and expectations to
                  bring your family and friends close to share your commitment to a life together!</li>


                <li>Q: I’m looking for someone that will get to know me and my partner. What’s the process?</li>
                <li>A: Sitting together, you’ll access a deep connection with your wedding,
                  and your marriage. I’ve worked with couples from three weeks to nine months
                  before their ceremony. We have a dialogue about what your wedding is marking,
                  what’s already true in your relationship, and the most resonant way to embody
                  that in a wedding ceremony that’s personal, memorable, and fun!</li>
